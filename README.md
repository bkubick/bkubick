### BRANDON KUBICK
#### SOFTWARE & MECHANICAL ENGINEER

I am a highly motivated individual seeking a mid-level position in Software Engineering. With a background as a Full-Stack Software Developer, and as an R&D Aerospace Engineer, I have excelled in both fields due to my strong focus, dedication, and passion for learning.

#### Current Projects
1. Actively implementing a personal profile using React to highlight my past experiences and skill set (private repository currently, but will make public once built).
2. I am slowly building out a personal website to help me manage my investment portfolio using Flask, Vue3, and TypeScript (private repository).
3. Venturing into the realm of C++ and physics simulations through the development of various genetic algorithms.
